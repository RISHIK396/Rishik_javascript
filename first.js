
// level 1 in javascript here we will see about variables concept 


// we can use consol.log to print the value in console block of javascript
console.log("hello world");

//below you can see variables which are containers which are used to store values in javascript 
let a =10;
let b= 20;

// printing the value of a and b variables
console.log("printing the value of a and b: ",a,"and",b);

// now we will see some valid and invalid variable names in javascript

// this is invalid
// let @tony_stark="hello";

// this is also iinvalid
// let $name=

// THIS IS A VALID VARIABLE NAME
let name123_$="TONY STARK";


// BOTH THE BELOW METIONED VARIABLES ARE DIFFERENT
let apple=20;
let Apple=25;

console.log(apple);
console.log(Apple);
